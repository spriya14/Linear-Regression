What is Linear Regression?

Imagine a set of points  being plotted for two given parameters.
Intuitively, there must be some sort of correlation between these two points.
Inorder to mathematically prove that there is a relationship between the parameters, we draw a line of best fit .
So how do we know that there exists a line of best fit or how do we find the line of best fit??

For that we use gradient descent-
      which basically just adds a random line, computes the error of that line .
      The error will act as a compass , it will tell us how best do we redraw the line to be closer to the line of best fit.
      And we will keep doing that until we get the best fit line !!
